# TOP Members Only Project

## Using :
(mainly)
- HTML/CSS/JS
- Express
- PostgresSQL
- Pug

## Goal :
Creating a simple and clean multi-page app where users can authenticate,
and access to pages depending on their authorizations.  
This project serves as a full-stack app to train on authentication within the Express Framework.

## Design

...inspired from daily.dev for the posts and page "general style" (sorry no vocabulary), and from "Secret Members", a realisation of that same project by someone else for the overall architecture (layout and navigation flow/routes mainly)
